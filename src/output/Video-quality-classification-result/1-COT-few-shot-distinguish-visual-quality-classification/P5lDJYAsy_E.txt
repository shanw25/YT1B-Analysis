Visual Key Event 1(non-visual): Emily introduces herself and the topic of the video, which is about extending a web scraper exercise by using command line options.
Visual Key Event 2(non-visual): Emily explains the new feature they want to add to the program, which is to output a summary statistic when the user inputs "-S".
Visual Key Event 3(non-visual): Emily starts modifying the program to look for the "-S" option in the command line.
Visual Key Event 4(non-visual): Emily demonstrates how to use the grep program to search for the "-S" option in the command line and remove it from the Arg V array.
Visual Key Event 5(non-visual): Emily tests the program to ensure that the "-S" option has been successfully removed from the Arg V array.
Visual Key Event 6(non-visual): Emily confirms that the program is working as expected, with the summary variable correctly set and the "-S" option removed from the Arg V array.
Visual Key Event 7(non-visual): Emily identifies the parts of the code where the printing behavior needs to be changed based on the summary flag variable.
Visual Key Event 8(non-visual): Emily modifies the program to calculate the total percentage and number of streams when the summary option is selected.
Visual Key Event 9(non-visual): Emily continues modifying the program to increment the total percentage and number of streams for each lecture stream found.
Visual Key Event 10(non-visual): Emily adds a check to the program to print the summary statistic if the summary option is selected.
Visual Key Event 11(non-visual): Emily tests the program with the summary option and confirms that it is working as expected.
Visual Key Event 12(non-visual): Emily tests the program without the summary option and confirms that the original behavior is retained.
Visual Key Event 13(non-visual): Emily concludes the video by summarizing the steps taken to add an option to the program and wishing the viewers luck in their labs.
