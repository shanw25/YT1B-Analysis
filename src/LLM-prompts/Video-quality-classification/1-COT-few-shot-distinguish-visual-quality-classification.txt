Third, assess and label each visual key event as "visual" or "non-visual" based on your knowledge of whether the context can be visualized or not. Finally, classify the video's quality into good or bad using the subtitles and extracted visual key events; you should classify the video based on the video's visual diversity, storyline clarity and complexity, alignment between visual key events and actual video, etc.

so when you are first trying to engage your audience consider these things one what is the most important message I need to communicate - how can I conveyed in a shortest possible time ie entice someone to engage and three is there a visual alternative that communicates this message in a stronger way by showing the sky more than the tower you can see that it\'s high up and uninterrupted you immediately process the message of success luxury prestige the image is used to engage and a flyer wants further details here the roadside imagery sparked the interest once the person is engaged they see the big posters interactive highlights how alcohol affects safe driving which is much better than saying this in a sentence could this be any more succinct its simplicity completely overrides complexity debate and brings it back to the most important message at the street fighter\' media there are so many benefits that I want to highlight to our potential clients we have 17 services we have ground teams in every state a campaign reporting is unmatched or maybe that we offer graphic design but when engaging someone for the first time the most important message that needs to be communicated is that we connect with the locals in ways that others can\'t and I can get into the details later so how do I convey the strongest possible message in the shortest amount of time a phrase that we commonly use avoiding any technical language is that we defy convention to create unique media spaces in public areas which is great but consider this visually communicating this message is much stronger and can be processed in a much shorter space of time it explains exactly what we do without using micro language or alienating a potential client once that person has engaged opportunities open up to go into all of those other motherless things so we\'re trying to engage your target take a step back and consider the strongest possible message in the shortest amount of time then take it a step further to see whether your message will be stronger if it were communicated visually
